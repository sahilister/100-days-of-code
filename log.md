**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: Oct 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Coded freeCodeCamp's technical documentation html file.

**Thoughts**: Was quite intrigued with the <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL">front-end of website </a> made only using html and css.


### Day 2: Oct 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made navbar and fixed on left on tech-doc. Did some basics arithmetic using javascript on freeCodeCamp.
